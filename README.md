## ðŸ§  What is Syfer?

**Syfer** is a mini-DSL (Domain-Specific Language) designed to describe how CSV columns should be transformed into Neo4j nodes and relationships.

Example Syfer Script:

```syfer
DEFINE NODE Person
  FROM COLUMN name, age
  SET label = "Person";

DEFINE RELATIONSHIP WORKS_AT
  FROM COLUMN company
  TO NODE Company
  SET type = "WORKS_AT";
